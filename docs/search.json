    "text": "CLAMS overview\nCLAMS is a text-based interactive environment for composing and performing music on a Raspberry Pi Pico H microcontroller board. This board costs about $5US and includes soldered male headers and a debug connector. The initial release of CLAMS uses a Pimoroni Pico Audio Pack for audio output. The audio pack provides stereo headphone and line outputs, and costs about $18US as of 2023-02-11.\nCLAMS is a domain-specific language built on a Forth real-time operating system / interpreter. The user connects to the board from a command line on a host computer and enters CLAMS code interactively.\nThe CLAMS language is designed to facilitate live coding. Using a mixture of pre-compiled code and real-time directives, the user creates a performance in real time. The philosophy of CLAMS is similar to that of ChucK (Salazar et al. 2014) - a single text-based language to implement both the definitions of synthesized instruments and the sequences of sounds they make, intended for live coding / algorave performances.\nCLAMS is based on Travis Bemann’s zeptoforth. If you’re new to Forth and want to get started, Brodie (2022) is the place to start. There are a few PDF versions of Starting Forth on the web, but many are older versions. The one you want is the web version at https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/.\nIf you’re already a Forth programmer, the zeptoforth words are documented at https://github.com/tabemann/zeptoforth/tree/master/html (HTML) and https://github.com/tabemann/zeptoforth/tree/master/epub (EPUB). For more details, see the zeptoforth wiki."

    "text": "You can find out more than you ever wanted to know about me on Bandcamp, LinkedIn and Mastodon. But briefly, I’m a retired scientific applications programmer with a near-life-long obsession with computer music - algorithmic composition and digital signal processing - and older forms of electronic music - musique concrète, East and West Coast analog synthesizers, and historic instruments like the Telharmonium, Trautonium, Theremin, and the Ondes Martenot.\nMy other obsession, a bit more recent, is microtonal music, especially music based on the theories of Erv Wilson. That’s a large enough obsession that it deserves its own project: Eikosany. But don’t worry - CLAMS will also be able to create microtonal music."
