I have migrated the few posts on this blog to my main blog, [AlgoCompSynth by znmeb](https://www.algocompsynth.com/ "AlgoCompSynth by znmeb"). That Ockham fellow had a pretty good idea; I wish I had listened to him.

I'll be posting CLAMS updates over there from now on. You'll find them at <https://www.algocompsynth.com/#category:CLAMS>. I'll set up a re-direct in a week or so, as soon as I figure out how to get GitHub Pages to do it.
